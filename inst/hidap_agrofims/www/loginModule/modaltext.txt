The Agronomy Field Information Management System (AgroFIMS) has been developed on CGIAR’s HIDAP (Highly-interactive Data Analysis Platform created by CGIAR’s International Potato Center, CIP). AgroFIMS draws fully on ontologies, particularly the Agronomy Ontology and the Crop Ontology. It consists of modules that represent the typical cycle of operations in agronomic trial management, and enables the creation of data collection sheets using the same ontology-based set of variables, terminology, units and protocols.
