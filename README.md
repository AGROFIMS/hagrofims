# AGROFIMS

Repository for the main application (app) of AGROFIMS. 

## Overview

The Agronomy Field Information Management System (AgroFIMS) has been developed based on CGIAR’s `HIDAP` (Highly-interactive Data Analysis Platform created by CGIAR’s `International Potato Center`, CIP). AgroFIMS draws fully on ontologies, particularly the Agronomy Ontology and the `Crop Ontology`. It consists of modules that represent the typical cycle of operations in agronomic trial management, and enables the creation of data collection sheets using the same ontology-based set of variables, terminology, units and protocols. AgroFIMS therefore:

Standardizes data collection and description for easy aggregation and inter-linking across disparate datasets;
Allows easy integration with HIDAP breeding data, or any other ontology-based datasets;
Functions as a data staging repository, allowing data uploads with view/edit permissions;
Enables data quality checks, statistical analysis of the data collected, and the generation of sophisticated statistics reports;
Aligns a priori with CGIAR’s CG Core metadata schema;
Enables easy upload to the institutional repositories, and much more.
Funding for AgroFIMS was provided by the `Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s Open Access`, `Open Data Initiative`, and the `CGIAR Big Data Platform`.
